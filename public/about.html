<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a developer in training with a strong foundation in HTML and CSS. I enjoy
  turning simple ideas into clean, responsive web layouts and I’m constantly
  improving my skills through hands-on projects and structured learning. I’m
  passionate about growth, consistency, and building interfaces that are both
  functional and visually clear.
